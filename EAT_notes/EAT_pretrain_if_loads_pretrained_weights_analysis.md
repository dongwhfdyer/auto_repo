I'll explore the EAT repository to trace through the shell command and determine if it loads any pretrained weights. Let me start by examining the key files and understanding the training flow.

Read file: EAT/scripts/pretraining_AS2M.sh
Now let me examine the config file to understand the model configuration:

Read file: EAT/config/pretraining_AS2M.yaml
Now let me examine the model initialization code to understand how weights are loaded:

Read file: EAT/models/EAT_pretraining.py
Let me look at the weight initialization part more closely:

Read file: EAT/models/EAT_pretraining.py
Let me look at the specific weight initialization part:

Read file: EAT/models/EAT_pretraining.py
Now let me check if there are any other initialization methods or pretrained weight loading mechanisms. Let me look at the task file to understand the training setup:

Ran tool
Read file: EAT/tasks/pretraining_AS2M.py
Let me check if there are any references to pretrained weights or model loading in the task setup:

Now let me check the specific configuration in the YAML file to see if there are any pretrained weight settings:

Ran tool
Let me check the config file more carefully for the mae_init setting:

Ran tool
Let me check the config file directly for this setting:

Ran tool
Let me check the config file content again to see if mae_init is set:

Ran tool
Let me read the config file again to see the exact content:

Read file: EAT/config/pretraining_AS2M.yaml
Now let me check if there are any other config files that might have different settings:

Ran tool
Let me check the finetuning config to see how it differs:

Read file: EAT/config/finetuning.yaml
Perfect! Now I can see the key difference. Let me also check if there are any references to the restore_file parameter in the fairseq framework:

Ran tool
Let me check the shell script again to understand the complete command:

Read file: EAT/scripts/pretraining_AS2M.sh
Now let me check the model initialization code more carefully to understand the weight initialization:

Read file: EAT/models/EAT_pretraining.py
Based on my exploration of the EAT repository, I can now provide you with a comprehensive answer about whether the shell script loads any pretrained weights.

## Analysis: Does the EAT pretraining script load pretrained weights?

**Answer: It depends on the scenario, but by default it does NOT load external pretrained weights.**

Here's the detailed breakdown:

### 1. **Model Initialization (No External Pretrained Weights)**
Looking at the model initialization code in `EAT/models/EAT_pretraining.py` (lines 243-247):

```python
if self.cfg.mae_init:
    self.apply(self._init_weights)
else:
    from fairseq.modules.transformer_sentence_encoder import init_bert_params
    self.apply(init_bert_params)
```

- The `mae_init` parameter is **NOT set** in your `pretraining_AS2M.yaml` config (it defaults to `False`)
- This means the model uses `init_bert_params` for weight initialization, which is a standard random initialization method
- **No external pretrained weights are loaded during model creation**

### 2. **Checkpoint Restoration (Resuming Training)**
The shell script includes:
```bash
checkpoint.restore_file=/hpc_stor03/sjtu_home/wenxi.chen/model_ckpt/test/checkpoint_last.pt
```

This parameter tells the training script to:
- **Resume training** from a previously saved checkpoint if it exists
- This is **NOT** loading external pretrained weights, but rather continuing from where you left off
- If the checkpoint file doesn't exist, training starts from scratch

### 3. **Comparison with Fine-tuning**
In contrast, the `finetuning.yaml` config shows how external pretrained weights are actually loaded:
```yaml
model:
  _name: mae_image_classification
  model_path: /hpc_stor03/sjtu_home/wenxi.chen/model_ckpt/EAT/checkpoint10.pt
```

### 4. **Key Differences**

| Aspect | Pretraining (AS2M) | Fine-tuning |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Model Name** | `data2vec_multi` | `mae_image_classification` |
| **Weight Init** | Random (init_bert_params) | Loaded from checkpoint |
| **Purpose** | Train from scratch | Fine-tune existing model |
| **Checkpoint** | Resume training | Load pretrained weights |

### **Conclusion:**
When you run `EAT/scripts/pretraining_AS2M.sh`:

1. **No external pretrained weights are loaded** - the model starts with random initialization
2. **It may resume from a previous training session** if `checkpoint_last.pt` exists
3. **This is a true pretraining setup** - you're training the model from scratch on your audio data
4. **The model will learn representations from your audio spectrograms** using the MAE (Masked Autoencoder) approach

If you want to ensure completely fresh training, you can remove the `checkpoint.restore_file` line from the shell script.
