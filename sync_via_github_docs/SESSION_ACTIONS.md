# Session actions log

This file documents all commands executed during this session, with brief outcomes, so you can audit or reproduce everything.

Working directory: `/Users/kuhn/Documents/code/auto_repo`

## Repo detection / init

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree || git init -b main
```
Outcome: repo already existed (`true`). No re-init.

## Checked for origin remote

```bash
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_ORIGIN"
```
Outcome: `NO_ORIGIN` (no origin set at that time).

## Set helpful git defaults and attempted to install auto-push hook (initial)

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
git config --global push.autoSetupRemote true
mkdir -p .git/hooks
# wrote .git/hooks/post-commit (auto-push)
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
```
Outcome: Intended to install hook, but later we discovered the file was not present.

## Wrote docs for other environments

- Created `OTHER_SERVER_SETUP.md` (Linux/macOS remote via cron or hook) using GitHub as bridge.
- Created `LOCAL_SETUP.md` documenting local intent and steps.

## Created Windows remote guide

- Created `REMOTE_SETUP.md` for Windows auto-pull at `C:\User\xiajiakun\Documents\code\auto_repo` (PowerShell + Scheduled Task).
- Added a pointer at top of `OTHER_SERVER_SETUP.md` for Windows users.

## Investigated missing auto-push (post-commit) hook

Checked hooks path and presence:

```bash
git config --get core.hooksPath || echo ".git/hooks (default)"
ls -l .git/hooks/post-commit
bash -lc '.git/hooks/post-commit'
```
Outcome:
- Hooks path: `.git/hooks (default)`
- `post-commit` not found (No such file or directory)

## Reinstalled the post-commit hook and tested

Install and test attempt 1:

```bash
mkdir -p .git/hooks
cat > .git/hooks/post-commit <<'SH'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

if git remote get-url origin >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
  if ! git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u} >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    git push -u origin "$current_branch"
  else
    git push
  fi
else
  echo "[post-commit] No 'origin' remote configured. Skipping auto-push."
fi
SH
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit

git commit --allow-empty -m "test: trigger auto-push hook"
```
Outcome: `ls` still showed no hook present when checked; proceeding to re-create explicitly.

Install and test attempt 2 (explicit printf):

```bash
printf '%s\n' '#!/usr/bin/env bash' 'set -euo pipefail' '' \
'if git remote get-url origin >/dev/null 2>&1; then' \
'  current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)' \
'  if ! git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u} >/dev/null 2>&1; then' \
'    git push -u origin "$current_branch"' \
'  else' \
'    git push' \
'  fi' \
'else' \
'  echo "[post-commit] No '\''origin'\'' remote configured. Skipping auto-push."' \
'fi' > .git/hooks/post-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit

git commit --allow-empty -m "test: trigger auto-push hook 3"
```
Verification:

```bash
echo "local:" && git rev-parse HEAD
echo "remote:" && git ls-remote origin -h refs/heads/main | awk '{print $1}'
```
Outcome: Hook worked; SHAs matched, and push output showed `main -> main` updated.

## Current state

- Auto-push hook installed at `.git/hooks/post-commit` and executable.
- `LOCAL_SETUP.md`, `OTHER_SERVER_SETUP.md`, and `REMOTE_SETUP.md` created/updated.

## What to do next

- Ensure `origin` remote points to your GitHub repo and commit normally. Each commit should auto-push.
- Use `REMOTE_SETUP.md` on the Windows machine for auto-pull.
